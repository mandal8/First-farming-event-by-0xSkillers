# Base Item Farming Challenge
# Objective: Players who farm the most hero hours of specific items will receive rewards based on their placement. The details are outlined below.
1.Eligible Items:
Hides
Small bones
Feathers
Coal
Logs (any wood type)
# 2. Calculating Hero Hours Farming:
The total items deposited divided by the rate per hour farmed equals the hero hours.
# Players should send the items to EVENTBOY (address: 0x6ac1035f2dd1554e3ea69808e5dd5450db695152) to receive credit.
# 3. Example:
Player Bunny Sue deposits 75,000 basic logs.
Player Lion Bob deposits 110,000 coal.
Hero hours calculation:
Bunny Sue: 75,000 / 120 = 625 hero hours
Lion Bob: 110,000 / 90 = 1222.2 hero hours
In this example, Lion Bob would place higher than Bunny Sue.
